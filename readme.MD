run_analysis.R

For the correct use of the script, you should put data unzipped in the working directory 
along with run_analysis.R.

Tidy data set

Running the script in the same directory with the raw data will output a tidy data set
according to the principles showed along the course.

Each measured variable is in one column
Each observation is in a different row
There is one table for each kind of variable (in this case, there is only one kind)
The file created, tidy.txt, is tab-delimited with an initial row containing variable names.
